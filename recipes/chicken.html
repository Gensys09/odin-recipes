            <h3>Chicken Marinade</h3>
            <li>Cube chicken to 1 to 1(1/2) inch pieces. Add them to a mixing bowl. Make sure there
                is no excess moisture in your chicken. If you want you may pat dry with a few
                kitchen tissues.</li>
            <li>Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric,
                salt, lemon juice, oil, ginger garlic paste, yogurt and kasuri methi. Skip the lemon
                juice if your yogurt is sour.</li>
            <li>Mix well. Cover with a cling wrap and refrigerate for minimum of 8 hours and up to
                48 hours. If you are in a rush, you may cut down to 3 hours.</li>
            <h3>Make Tikka Sauce</h3>
        </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pot or pan. Add onions and sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt. Saute
                    until deep golden.</li>
                <li>Add ginger garlic paste and green chilli. Saute until aromatic, for 40 to 60 seconds.</li>

                    and cumin powder. Stir well quickly.</li>
                <li>Pour tomato puree and cook on a medium high heat until the onion tomato masala
                    becomes really thick and begins to leave the sides of the pan. It also turns
                    fragrant.</li>
                <li>Pour 2 cups of hot water and cover. Simmer until thick, yet of pouring consistency.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How to Make Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grill in Oven : While the gravy simmers, thread the chicken to the metal skewers
                    or soaked bamboo skewers and place them in a prepared tray. Bake them in a
                    preheated oven at 460 F or 240 C for 9 to 10 mins. Turn them to the other side
                    with a tong and grill then for another 9 to 10 mins. To char the chicken, broil for 2
                    to 3 mins or until slightly charred.</li>
                <li>Or In a Skillet: Pour 1 tbsp oil to a skillet and heat it well. Place the chicken tikka
                    one by one, spacing them apart. Cook on a medium high heat for 3 mins, turn
                    them to the other side with a tong and cook for another 3 mins, until charred and
                    not essentially fully cooked. Remove to a plate and Cook in batches.</li>
                <li>Or In the Air fryer: Thread on skewers and place them in the basket or in the tray.
                    Air fry for 6 mins, at 400 F or 200 C. Turn them with tongs and air fry for another 6
                    mins. If they dry out, you may baste with marinade and continue for another 2
                    mins, until slightly charred.</li>
                <li>When the tikka masala turns thick, add sugar and the cream (or cashew cream,
                    check notes to make your own). Stir well and cook for a few minutes until thick,
                    creamy and aromatic.</li>
                <li>Add the grilled chicken tikka and crushed kasuri methi. (Make sure your gravy has
                    reached a thick gravy consistency/serving consistency, before adding chicken).
                    Stir and cook for 2 to 3 mins until chicken tikka is soft and tender. Taste test and
                    add more salt and sugar if needed.</li>
                <li>Turn off and garnish with cream and coriander leaves. Serve chicken tikka masala
                    with Butter Naan, roti, paratha, basmati rice or Jeera rice.</li>
